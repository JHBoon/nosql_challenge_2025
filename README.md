# nosql_challenge_2025
This project analyzes a dataset of restaurants in the UK. We inserted new restaurant information, filtered by requirements such as "highest health score" or "closest to new restaurant," and added a variety of options.
The project is split over two different documents: "NoSQL_setup_starter" is used to load the data from a CSV file into a MongoDB database and insert new documents. "NoSQL_analysis_starter_JB.ipynb" is used to filter the documents and create overviews and dataframes.

This project is part of the Data Analyst Bootcamp at the University of California, Irvine.

This project used:

- MongoDB
- PyMongo
- Pandas
- Python
- Visual Studio Code
- XpertAI Assistant

This was a solo project by Jay Boon.
